<h2>Front office</h2>
<b>Guest has been checked out and we forgot to add a transaction. How we do that now?</b>
<p>There are two ways. For security reasons both are available to admins only.</p>
<ol><li>If the room is not occupied, rechecking the guest using 'Recheckin' menu
option.
<li>You can also post transaction to any checked-out guest by using its res_id
instead of room number in guest charges form.
</ol>

<h2>City Ledger</h2>
These are some important points to keep in mind when using city ledger functions.
Please note that any kind of editing or deletion is reserved for ADMIN users only.
<ol><li>To make GL accounts appear on receipts screen, mark them as ’Cash Account’
in chart of accounts.
<li>Company should be marked 'allow credit' before the company guest is checked
out on BTC code. This is normally done by accounts department.
<li>If you have made an invoice incorrectly, you can delete it and the data in this
invoice will go back to 'unbilled' status. You can later create it again.
<li>You can always edit an invoice to add more checkout transactions to it.
<li>There are two invoice numbers: Once is sytem generated and cannot be
changed. The other (inv num2) can be edited by the user. By default system
inv num is copied to inv num2.
</ol>

<h2>General ledger integration</h2>
<h3>How city ledger companies are linked to general ledger?</h3>
<ol><li>New city ledger companies are created using ’Companies and Rates’ menu
option and each company has a general ledger linking account. This account
can be one account for all companies and individual account for each company
in chart of account. The normal practice is to have one single gl account for
all companies.
<li>When you open a new company and leave account number blank, then the
account specified in GL_CITY_LEDGER preference is assigned to this new
company.
<li>If GL_CITY_LEDGER value is ’NA’ then an auto-generated and unique ac-
count is created in chart of accounts. Its number is generated by joining
GL_AR_PREFIX and GL_AR_NEXT preferences. This new account is then
assigned to the new company.
<li>For existing companies you can always change the account number by editing
them and set to any value.
<li>If you change linking account for any customer then you will need to repost
SJVs for any date when this customer had guests in your hotel.
</li></ol>

<h3>How sales from front office are transferred to general ledger?</h3>
Understanding following points is important to understand the process.
<ol><li>Guest is charged for services using charge codes. Charges codes are also used
to record receipts from guests. These charge codes are defined in Setup–
Charge Codes.
<li>Each charge code has a debit and credit general ledger account.
<li>When we run the 'Post Sales JV' process, a single JV (called Sales JV or SJV)
for the particular date is posted to GL. This JV contains summary of all front
office transactions for that date. This JV can be reconciled with ’Charges
Summary’ report.
</ol>

<h3>How city ledger (receivables, invoices, receipts) are linked to general ledger?</h3>
Here is summary of how it is done:
<ol><li>Receivable (city ledger) is booked into general ledger when a company guest
checks out on BTC charge code.
<li>Invoice is not yet made and this checkout guest record is shown in 'Unbilled
BTC checkouts'.
<li>No effect is recorded in general ledger when invoice is made. Making invoice
just moves transactions from 'unbilled' to 'invoices'.
<li>Once invoices are made, you can record receipts against invoices. During
receipt, you select the bank or cash account where this particular receipt is
being recorded.
<li>When you run 'Post Sales JV' every day, a single JV (called Receipts JV or
RJV) is created along with SJV. This contains summary from all the city
ledger receipts you have entered in a particular date.
</ol>

<h3>How suppliers / vendors are linked with general ledger?</h3>
<ol><li>When you open a new supplier / vendor, you specify its GL account in chart
of account. Please note that you need to add individual account in chart for
each vendor.
<li>If you open a new vendor and GL_PAYABLE preference is NA then the vendor
GL account is automatically assigned by combining GL_AP_PREFIX and
GL_AP_NEXT.
</oL>

<h3>How inventory is linked with general ledger?</h3>
Here is brief summary how it is done:
<ol><li>You specify general ledger accounts to ’GL Inventory’ and ’GL Expense’ ac-
count for item categories.
<li>You run ’Post Inventory JVs’ process every day. Two JVs are created. One
is called ’PJV’ (purchase JV) which updates your vendor GL account and
increases your inventory GL account. The other is called ’ICV’ (Issue Con-
sumption Voucher) which decreases your inventory assets and books the value
in expense.
<li>To make payments to your suppliers you can make a journal entry.
</ol>

<h3>We have done some editing. Now system generated
vouchers (SJV, RJV, PJV, ICV) are not accurate. What
should we do?</h2>
<p>Just repost the respective vouchers to update them. No duplicate occurs by repost-
ing the system generated vouchers for a particular date.</p>
<p>You will need to repost system generated JVs if you changed any or all of the
followings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Linking accounts for companies.
<li>Linking accounts for charge codes.
<li>Linking accounts for vendors.
<li>Linking accounts for inventory categories or locations.
<li>Guest past data (guest charges)
<li>City ledger receipts.
<li>Purchase or issue inventory transactions.
</ol>

<h2>Auditing</h2>
We make audit log of important transactions and columns. For software speed and
efficiency reasons we only maintain logs of important data. Here are reports which
can help you see what changes are being done to the system.
<ol>
    <li>Rate change report shows the room rate changed for an inhouse guest.
    <li>Room change report shows the room number change of an inhouse guest.
    <li>Room status change report shows when the status of a room a changed to
some new value.
<li>Audit log shows the documents edited.
<li>Change log shows the specific columns edited with old and new values.
</ol>
