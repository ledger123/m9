<h1>Common fraud vectors</h1>
Here we are listing some possibilities which can be used by front office staff /
cashiers to commit financial fraud.
<ol>
<li>Room has been actually checked-out but not in Munshi9 and reused for some
other guest.
<li>Guest has paid cash but this payment is shown either as BTC or credit card
payment.
<li>Some old advance is adjusted against a room and cash is pocketed.
<li>A walk-in guest is shown as company guest and checked out as BTC to that
company. Cash taken is pocketed.
<li>A charge is posted to the guest, folio printed and then that charge is cancelled.
<li>Rebate is offered to the client without any approval.
<li>Lower room rate is charged to the guest (with the help of guest) and the
difference of actual verses lower room rate is pocketed.
</ol>
