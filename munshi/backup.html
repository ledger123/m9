<h1>Daily backup procedure</h1>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each backup file 'hotelname.dmp.gz' contains complete backup of every transaction.</li>
<li>It is recommend to keep backup for ALL dates safe on a DVD or a hard disk or a USB.
<li>If this is not possible then we recommend to keep at least one file for every one.
</ol>

<h2>Auto backup</h2>
Backup file is generated automatically after 4 hours in the /root/munshi9/backups/ folder on server. You need to copy the daily backup file from server to some other computer, usb or harddisk. To do this:

<ol>
   <li><a href="http://mavsol.com/misc/mini/winscp.exe">Download and install WINSCP. (first time only)</a>
   <li>Connect to munshi9 server using winscp. Put server ip address in host name, 'root' in user and your server password.
   <li>Go to munshi9 folder and then backups folder. Here you will see all backup files with dates.
   <li>Select and drag the backup file to your PC window.
</ol>

<h2>Manual backup</h2>
Sometimes you may need to take manual backup for debugging or restoring on other server. For this:

<ol>
<li>Login with putty (armaghan@your-ip-address) or directly on server.
<li>Run following commands.
<pre>
    cd /root/munshi9/backups/
    ./genbackup.sh
</pre>
<li>Copy backup using winscp.
</ol>

<h2>Online backup</h2>
Dropbox is a very easy and secure way to keep your munshi9 backups safe online.
<ol>
<li><a href="https://db.tt/7jD1e5Ok">Click here to create your free dropbox account.</a>
<li>Download and install dropbox software on your computer.
<li>Copy the backup files from server to your dropbox folder. These files will be uploaded to your dropbox account online.
<li>There is 2.5 GB limit of each free account. You can create a new account with a new email address if your existing account gets filled up.
</ol>

<h2>CNIC scans and templates backup</h2>
You need to copy CNIC scan images (in /root/munshi9/uploads/) and templates (/root/munshi9/tmpl/) using WINSCP. These are not backed-up with the database. In case of any confusion, send email to <a href="ar.saqib@gmail.com">ar.saqib@gmail.com</a> for clarity.
